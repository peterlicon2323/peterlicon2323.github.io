[on personl information] (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. [on personl information] also made groundbreaking contributions to quantum theory. 🚀 His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², arising from special relativity, is hailed as "the world's most famous equation." 🧮 He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, especially his discovery of the photoelectric effect. 🏆

Born in the German Empire, [on personl information] moved to Switzerland in 1895, renouncing his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at age seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich, graduating in 1900. 📚 He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, maintaining it for life, and secured a position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he earned his PhD from the University of Zürich. 🎓 In 1914, he relocated to Berlin, joining the Prussian Academy of Sciences and Humboldt University, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917, and regaining German citizenship. In 1933, amid Nazi rise, he stayed in the United States, gaining American citizenship in 1940. 🇺🇸 On the brink of World War II, he alerted President Roosevelt to potential German nuclear threats.
In 1905, his annus mirabilis, [on personl information] published four revolutionary papers outlining the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence. 🔬 In 1915, he introduced general relativity, extending mechanics to include gravitation. A 1916 cosmological paper explored universe modeling, while his 1917 work on spontaneous and stimulated emission laid foundations for lasers and quantum optics. 💡 Mid-career, he advanced statistical mechanics and quantum theory, proposing photons and Bose–Einstein statistics. Later, he critiqued quantum randomness and pursued a unified field theory, growing isolated from mainstream physics.
