## About Me

### Introduction
Greetings, I am a German-born theoretical physicist, renowned for developing the theory of relativity. My most celebrated contribution, the mass-energy equivalence formula \( E = mc^2 \), derived from special relativity, is widely recognized as the world's most famous equation. I also made significant advancements in quantum theory, notably through my explanation of the photoelectric effect, which earned me the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.

### Personal Philosophy
Imagination is more important than knowledge, for it fuels discovery. I firmly believe that the universe operates with order, not chance, as I once remarked, "God does not play dice with the universe."

### Background and Education
Born on March 14, 1879, in the German Empire, I relocated to Switzerland in 1895, renouncing German citizenship. In 1897, at age seventeen, I enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich, graduating in 1900. I acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which I retained for life. In 1905, I earned my PhD in Physics from the University of Zürich. My career included a stint at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, followed by academic roles in Berlin at the Prussian Academy of Sciences and Humboldt University, where I also served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1917. In 1933, due to the rise of the Nazi regime, I settled in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1940. I spent my later years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

### Scientific Contributions
My *annus mirabilis* in 1905 saw the publication of four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence. In 1915, I introduced general relativity, revolutionizing our understanding of gravitation. My 1916 cosmological work explored universe modeling, and my 1917 paper on spontaneous and stimulated emission laid the groundwork for lasers and quantum optics. I also advanced statistical mechanics, proposed the concept of photons, and contributed to Bose–Einstein statistics. Later in life, I pursued a unified field theory and expressed skepticism about quantum mechanics' reliance on randomness, which distanced me from mainstream physics.
